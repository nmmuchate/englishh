# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Static UI only — no backend, no real auth, no real audio; all data is hardcoded mock
- [Init]: Quasar components (QBtn, QCard, QChatMessage, QStepper, QTabs, QDialog, QFab) used throughout — no raw HTML equivalents
- [Init]: Tailwind classes in Stitch exports must be translated to Quasar utility classes + scoped CSS; no Tailwind dependency added
- [Init]: Vocabulary Bank page (VOCAB-01, VOCAB-02) has no Stitch source — build from design system tokens

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: axios boot file must be stripped/replaced before any page work begins — leaving it risks accidental real HTTP calls in dev
- [Phase 1]: quasar.config.js currently loads roboto-font and material-icons from @quasar/extras — need to switch to Inter via Google Fonts and Material Symbols Outlined per design spec
